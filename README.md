This are my config files & scripts for [Awesome](http://awesome.naquadah.org/)

- grep the files for /home/strenka and replace it with your home. Some places in configs just refuse to eval ~ or $HOME, so I had to hardcode it
- check battery.lua and change paths to your system battery info files if necessary
